# Frontend Architecture

This refactoring follows React best practices and separation of concerns principles.

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
- Each component has one clear purpose
- Hooks are focused on specific concerns (API vs state management)
- Services handle only API communications

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Components**: Pure UI and user interactions
- **Hooks**: Business logic and state management
- **Services**: External API communication
- **Types**: Type definitions and interfaces

### 3. Component Composition
- App.tsx now focuses on composition rather than implementation
- Components are small, focused, and reusable
- Clear data flow through props

### 4. Custom Hooks for Logic Reuse
- `useFeedsApi`: Handles all API operations with loading states
- `useFeedManagement`: Coordinates feed operations and state

### 5. Type Safety
- All interfaces extracted to dedicated type files
- Strong typing throughout the application
- Better IDE support and error catching

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Maintainability**: Each file has a clear purpose and is easy to locate
2. **Testability**: Components and hooks can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Components and hooks can be reused across the application
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without modifying existing code
5. **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support, clearer imports, easier debugging

## Key Components

### App.tsx (24 lines vs 171 lines)
- Now purely focused on composition
- Uses custom hooks for all business logic
- Clean and readable

### Custom Hooks
- **useFeedsApi**: Manages API calls, loading states, and error handling
- **useFeedManagement**: Coordinates feed operations and maintains feed state

### Components
- **FeedForm**: Controlled form with validation
- **FeedList**: Displays feeds with empty state handling
- **FeedItem**: Individual feed with delete functionality
- **StatusMessage**: Reusable message component
- **PageLayout**: Consistent page structure

This architecture makes the codebase much more maintainable and follows React community best practices.
