## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
**Risk**: Feed parsing complexity and format variations
**Mitigation**: Use established RSS parsing libraries, implement comprehensive testing with various feed formats, graceful error handling

**Risk**: Full-text search performance with large article datasets
**Mitigation**: Implement incremental indexing, use efficient search algorithms (SQLite FTS or Tantivy), optimize database queries

**Risk**: Offline sync conflicts and data consistency
**Mitigation**: Implement conflict resolution strategies, use atomic operations, maintain data integrity checks

### MVP Scope Management
**Risk**: Feature creep leading to delayed MVP delivery
**Mitigation**: Strictly prioritize Phase 1 features, defer advanced features to later phases, focus on core reading experience first

**Risk**: Over-engineering the annotation system early
**Mitigation**: Start with simple highlighting, iterate based on user feedback, build complexity gradually

### Resource Constraints
**Risk**: Complex cross-platform compatibility issues
**Mitigation**: Leverage Tauri's cross-platform capabilities, test early on target platforms, use platform-specific optimizations when needed

**Risk**: Performance issues with large feed collections
**Mitigation**: Implement pagination, lazy loading, efficient database indexing, background processing for heavy operations
